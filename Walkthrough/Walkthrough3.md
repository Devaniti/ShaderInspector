If you want to make any edits to your shader and recompile it, Shift+Alt+O may be useful  
It'll repeat last compilation command, without any prompts  
If you have multiple shader declarations in your file, it'll skip selection  
If you decided not to add shader declaration it'll reuse manually entered parameters  
Please note that if you edit shader declaration, Shift+Alt+O will still use old parameters
